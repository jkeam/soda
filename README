This is sorta like Bundler for Ruby.  Groovy has a neat dependency management tool called called Grape, but I didn't like how the dependency information was all jumbled up in with the source.  So I took the naming convention of node's package.json file and Bundlers bundle exec to create soda.

Installation
-----------------
Simply clone this repo to get the soda.groovy script.

Usage
-----------------
Go ahead and run ./soda.groovy (assuming groovy and grape are in your path)

You will see a quick explaination along with two options, one for help which is the same as running with no options, and one for running with the -f <filename> option.

To run:
1.  cd to where your groovy script is (the one you want the dependencies to be included with), lets call it carbination.groovy
2.  create a package.json with your dependencies
3.  run soda.groovy -f ./carbination.groovy 

*Doesn't matter where soda.groovy is as long as you can see and run it, but you must be in the same dir as your file (carbination.groovy) and your package.json

Example
-----------------
My test is a good example of how to use soda.

To run:
1.  cd to test
2.  ../soda.groovy -f ./test.groovy
