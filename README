This is sorta like Bundler for Ruby.  Groovy has a neat dependency management tool called called Grape, but I didn't like how the dependency information was all jumbled up in with the source.  So I took the naming convention of node's package.json file and Bundlers bundle exec to create soda.

Installation
-----------------
Simply clone this repo to get the soda.groovy script.

Usage
-----------------
Go ahead and run ./soda.groovy (assuming groovy and grape are in your path) with no args to see the help.


To run executable:
1.  cd to where your groovy script is (the one you want the dependencies to be included with), lets call it carbination.groovy
2.  create a package.json with your dependencies
3.  run soda.groovy -e ./carbination.groovy 

*Doesn't matter where soda.groovy is as long as you can see and run it, but you must be in the same dir as your file (carbination.groovy) and your package.json

To run tests:
If instead you have tests that you want to run (tests that extend GroovyTestCase), run it with the -t option.
soda.groovy -t ./tests.groovy

Example
-----------------
Executable
1.  cd to test
2.  ../soda.groovy -e ./carbination.groovy
